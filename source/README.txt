And here's a new one: Striped, which features a clean, minimalistic design, styling for 
all basic page elements (including blockquotes, tables and lists), a repositionable 
sidebar (left or right), and HTML5/CSS3 code designed for quick and easy customization 
(see code comments for details).

you can use for pretty much whatever.
